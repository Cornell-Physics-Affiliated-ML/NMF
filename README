 nmf.c: online non-negative matrix factorization by conservative learning
 ************************************************************************

 compile:	gcc -O2 nmf.c -lm -o nmf

 run:		./nmf datafile codesize weight datasize batchsize id


 datafile:	ASCII file of data vectors; the header is a single line 		of two integers: the number of data and the size of the 		data vectors.

 codesize:	number of feature vectors

 weight:		relative weight assigned to encoder/decoder changes

 datasize:	number of data to process; data are recycled when this 		exceeds the number of data in the datafile

 batchsize:	number of data processed between outputs

 id:		string id for the output files; reconstruction error is 		written to id.log, the model is written to id.model
